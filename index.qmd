### Personal Statement

I am interested in herbivore-plant interactions, especially between Lepidopterans and their food-plants. I seek to qualify how these relationships will change in response to disturbances such as exotic species invasion and climate change. I am eager to engage with community scientists in data collection and environmental education.
